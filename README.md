## Assignment 2 (Due: 29/04/22)

### Problem Statement
Parse and store differen shapes (Circles, Polygons and Semi-Circles) into a doubly linked list. This list
uses a single sentinel node and implements a generic list iterator. The iterator will be used to traverse the
list and add to a second sorted linked list (sorted into descending order with respect to their shape area) and
print both lists to the console.
